/**
 * MembraneRTC client.
 * <p>
 * The client is responsible for relaying MembraneRTC Engine specific messages through given reliable transport layer.
 * Once initialized, the client is responsible for exchanging necessary messages via provided <strong>EventTransport</strong> passed via `ConnectOptions` and managing underlying
 * `PeerConnection`. The goal of the client is to be as lean as possible, meaning that all activities regarding the session such as moderating
 * should be implemented by the user himself on top of the <strong>MembraneRTC</strong>.
 * <p>
 * The user's ability of interacting with the client is greatly limited to the essential actions such as joining/leaving the session,
 * adding/removing local tracks and receiving information about remote peers and their tracks that can be played by the user.
 * <p>
 * User can request 3 different types of local tracks that will get forwarded to the server by the client:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>`LocalAudioTrack` - an audio track utilizing device's microphone</li>
 *   <li>`LocalVideoTrack` - a video track that can utilize device's camera or if necessary use video playback from a file (useful for testing with a simulator)</li>
 *   <li>`LocalScreencast` - a screencast track capturing a device's screen using <string>MediaProjection</strong> mechanism</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to request necessary audio and video tracks before joining the room but it does not mean it can't be done afterwards (in case of screencast)
 * <p>
 * Once the user received <strong>onConnected</strong> notification they can call the <strong>join</strong> method to initialize joining the session.
 * After receiving `onJoinSuccess` a user will receive notification about various peers joining/leaving the session, new tracks being published and ready for playback
 * or going inactive.
